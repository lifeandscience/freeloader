			dt What is this all about? How does this relate to real life? 

			dd
				p Freeloader is designed to shed light on how we interpret social situations involving sharing and cooperation and how we make decisions about fairness, ownership, and resource allocation.

				p Public goods and services are things that you may be able to use without paying directly, that anyone in the community can use, and that may be used by multiple people at once. Fresh air and public lands and beaches are public goods, and in many societies, so are street lighting, national defense, and public radio. Private goods are things owned and controlled by individuals. Non-owners must pay to use them, owners can decide who uses them, and when they have been used, others cannot benefit from them. Food, clothing, and many automobiles are private goods. 

				p A freeloader or free-rider is someone who benefits from using public goods without helping fund or maintain them. In some cases, overuse of a public good by free-riders leads to fees or restrictions on use or access—in effect, turning public into private goods. In many societies, vigorous debate occurs over whether certain kinds of goods or services, such as basic medical care, should be public or private, and if public, how those services should be funded. 

				p Social scientists study how people think about public and private goods and services to learn about how we balance self-interest against the interests of the larger community, how we weigh short-term versus long-term outcomes, and how we define the communities to which we belong. We are all rationally motivated to seek short-term gains for ourselves—but too little attention paid to broader, longer-term outcomes may eventually lead to the tragedy of the commons, a situation in which a shared good on which many people depend is destroyed by the actions of individuals acting primarily out of self-interest.

			dt When I type my decision into the answer field, how do I know it has been saved?

			dd
				p After you type your decision, hit enter (or tap done on your smartphone) and you will see your decision turn yellow when it has been saved.

			dt What if I submitted my decision and later realize that I want to change it?

			dd
				p You can change your decision any time before the deadline for that day. Simply highlight your previous decision and type your new one and hit enter (or tap done on your smartphone).

			dt Will the deadline always be at the same time every day? 

			dd
				p Yes. The deadline will always be at 11:59pm Eastern Time.

			dt How is my bank calculated? 

			dd
				p Every day, everyone is given one dollar. Everyone decides to use it to leave the group or, if they want to stay, to invest that dollar in the group pool or to keep it. At the end of the day, we double whatever was invested in the group pool and divide that equally among all players who stayed, regardless of whether they invested or freeloaded. Your bank is the accumulation of what you’ve earned throughout the month.  If you use your dollar to leave the group, you will be added to a new group starting the next day.

			dt Does my bank balance move with me when I leave a group, or do I start from scratch? 

			dd
				p Your bank balance always moves with you. You keep adding to the same bank even when you move groups. However, if you unenroll or your group is disbanded because no one invested, then you lose your bank and must re-enroll to start over.

			dt Who else is in my group? 

			dd
				p Your group is assigned randomly and is comprised of other Experimonthers. They are anonymous so that you must make your decision in absence of the ability to communicate with them.

			dt Can I communicate with my group members?

			dd
				p You cannot. The game has been designed to explicitly prevent communication.

			dt What happens when I leave a group? 

			dd
				p If you leave your group, you are randomly assigned to another group. In some cases, a new group will be created for you and others. All groups must be at least three people.

			dt Is there any way to kick someone out of my group? 

			dd
				p No. The only mechanism you have to cope with freeloaders is to leave a group.

			dt Why was I assigned to a new group when I didn’t choose to leave a group?

			dd
				p The group you were in grew too small, so you were randomly assigned to another group. All groups must be at least three people.

			dt How is the group bank calculated?

			dd
				p The group bank is the total of the individual banks of all members in that group on that day.

			dt How do I have more money than some of the other people in my group when I’ve invested every day (never freeloaded)? 

			dd
				p When players decide to freeload, they receive their share of the group’s pool in addition to keeping the dollar they were given that day. For example, if there are four people in a group and one person decides to Freeload, the math looks like this: 

				ul.list
					li Person A: invests $1
					li Person B: invests $1
					li Person C: invests $1
					li Person D: freeloads and keeps $1

				p At the end of the day, the group pool is $3. We double that ($6), divide it equally (6 divided by 4 = $1.50), and distribute it to each person’s bank.

				ul.list
					li Investor A bank: $1.50
					li Investor B bank: $1.50
					li Investor C bank: $1.50
					li Freeloader D bank: $2.50

				p Alternatively, if all invest, the group pool would be $4, doubled $8, and divided equally, $2 per person.

				p If all freeload, the group is disbanded.

				p If all but one freeload, the group pool would be $1, doubled $2, and divided equally 50¢ and distributed accordingly: 

				ul.list
					li Freeloader A bank: $1.50
					li Freeloader B bank: $1.50
					li Freeloader C bank: $1.50
					li Investor D bank: 50¢
