/*


	(A) Put users without a group into a new group.
x		1) Find all new players without a group.
x		2) Find all current players with todaysAction=leavegroup (Take note of their current group)
x		3) Compute total number of groups (ceiling[# players / 10])
		4) Distribute all players from #1/#2 into groups. 
			- make sure not to put player into group he was just in.
			- Need to create a new group if the results from #3 > current_num_groups
			- TODO: Probably need to spend some time thinking about this algorithm.
			- Minimum group size = 3 players
		5) Check all groups again to make sure no groups have < 3 members. If they do, need to reassign these users and delete group.
		6) Notify users that they have been (re)assigned to a new group.
		7) TODO: Push some sort of events to the Auth Server and log?
	
	(B) For each group, loop through all players and look at their todayAction. 
		Keep count of total group $ invested. Also, keep temporary array of eligiblePlayers
x		0) If player.todaysAction=null, check for defaultAction. If no default, set todaysAction=freeload (TODO: is this correct?).
x		1) If they invest, add $1 to the group dailyTally. Push player to eligiblePlayers.
x		2) If they freeload, push player to eligiblePlayers and increase balance by $1.
x		3) If they leave, do nothing. (costs $1 to leave)
x		4) After all players have been processed, Take the total $ in dailyTally and double it.
x		5) Loop all players again and Take dailyTally/eligiblePlayers.length and add this money to each eligiblePlayer's balance.
		6) Log {Player/ExpID/GroupID/Date/Action/NewBalance} so we can track this stuff historically.
x		7) Copy player.todaysAction to player.lastAction.
x		8) Reset player.todaysAction => null
x		9) Save player !
